# Compatibility Macros

Carma provides some macros to allow compatibility across compilers and C language dialects,
as long as you have any of these:

- Any compiler supporting GCC or Clang extensions
- Any compiler supporting C23
- Any compiler supporting C++11

In practice that means that these common compilers work:

- GCC 4.9 or newer in C or C++ mode
- Clang 3.3 or newer in C or C++ mode
- MSVC 2013 or newer in C++ mode

## Type Inference

* `CARMA_AUTO` is used for type inference.
It is similar to `auto` in C++11 and C23,
and the `__auto_type` extension in GCC and Clang.
It is mainly for internal library usage.
Example:
```c
CARMA_AUTO my_int = 10;
CARMA_AUTO my_double = 3.14;
```

* `CARMA_TYPE_OF` is used to get the type of an expression.
It is similar to `typeof` in C23 and `decltype` in C++11,
and the `__typeof__` extension in GCC and Clang.
It is mainly for internal library usage.
Example:
```c
for (CARMA_TYPE_OF(count) index = 0; index < count; ++index) {
    ...
}
```

## Aggregate Construction

`MAKE(type, ...)` is used for constructing values of structs, unions and arrays,
in a way that is supported by both C and C++. Example:

```c
// Carma:
MAKE(Vec3, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0)

// Results in this in C:
(Vec3){1.0, 2.0, 3.0}

// Results in this in C++:
Vec3{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}
```

The `MAKE` version is also easier to type on a (Swedish) keyboard,
compared to the raw C version that mixes different kind of braces.

The `MAKE` macro can also be used for designated initializers,
if your compiler supports C99 or C++20:

```C
MAKE(Color, .red=0.5, .green=0.0, .blue=1.0)
```


## Linkage

`CARMA_BEGIN_EXTERN_C` and `CARMA_END_EXTERN_C` can be used to make functions declared in a C header link correctly when called from C++.
It prevents name mangling issues.
Place `CARMA_BEGIN_EXTERN_C` before the declarations in a C header and `CARMA_END_EXTERN_C` after them.
Example:
```c
#pragma once

#include <stdint.h>
#include <carma/carma_extern_c.h>

CARMA_BEGIN_EXTERN_C

uint8_t sample_random_u8();
uint16_t sample_random_u16();
uint32_t sample_random_u32();
uint64_t sample_random_u64();

CARMA_END_EXTERN_C
```
